    <h2><strong>Description:</strong></h2>
    <p>BY FAR THE BEST Lasagna you'll ever eat. I've made this many times! The entire family beg for this all the time!!I however add extra seasoning, I simmer for 3hrs and instead of sweet sausage I use real maple syrup. I also use 2lb of ricotta cheese instead of what it calls for because in my opinion extra ricotta is very needed. I also use double the cheese, and add cheddar cheese to the top. I suppose it's now my own recipe but I appreciate the base line.
        I also use this same sauce recipe for spaghetti with my own special family secrets.</p>
